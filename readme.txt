Shiku the ninja starts with the menu. At the menu, 
when play it clicked you are redirected to the game play html which will load the game play area and the sprite sheets needed
the game is be a general platform game with arrow controls for the player
the expected frame rate is 30fps to  keep the grahpics easy  on the bowser.
Speed is yet to be determined for the player run speed  but  it will have to be synced with the frame rate of the spritesheet
currently I  have three different animations  for  the player, including
a general running sheet, a jumping sheet, and a die sheet. 
when the spacebar is pressed for the jump function, the sprite sheet needs to change to the 
jumping animation seemlessly. Same with  the die animation when there is a collision. If the play falls off the map then no animation is needed
mainly because the character will be off screen.
What I would like to happen with the options menu is to be able to change the diffucultly and turn the sound on and off.
with the difficulty portion. the only thing it will adjust is the speed of the character across the map. Going slower for lower difficulty.
